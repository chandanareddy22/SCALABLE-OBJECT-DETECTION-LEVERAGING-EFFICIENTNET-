## Introduction
Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision with applications ranging from surveillance to autonomous driving. In this project, we leverage **EfficientNet**, a highly scalable and efficient convolutional neural network architecture, to build an object detection model that balances accuracy and computational efficiency.

The model is designed to be scalable for different resource constraints, allowing it to run on edge devices, mobile platforms, and cloud environments.

## Features
- **EfficientNet Backbone**: EfficientNet is utilized for feature extraction, providing both efficiency and accuracy.
- **Scalable**: The architecture can be easily scaled up or down based on the available computational resources.
- **Customizable Detection Head**: The detection head can be modified for different use cases.
- **Multi-Class Object Detection**: Capable of detecting multiple object categories in a single image.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Optimized for real-time performance in practical applications.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chandanareddy22/SCALABLE-OBJECT-DETECTION-LEVERAGING-EFFICIENTNET.git
   cd SCALABLE-OBJECT-DETECTION-LEVERAGING-EFFICIENTNET
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Download or prepare your dataset in the required format (COCO, Pascal VOC, etc.).
2. Modify the configuration file as needed for your dataset and model requirements.
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --config config.yaml
   ```

5. Perform inference on new images:
   ```bash
   python infer.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```

## Dataset
The model supports various datasets such as **COCO** and **Pascal VOC**. Make sure your dataset is properly formatted before training.

## Training
To train the model, you can modify the training configuration (e.g., batch size, learning rate, number of epochs) in the `config.yaml` file. Run the training script:
```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

## Results
After training, the model performance can be evaluated on the test set, and key metrics such as mAP (mean Average Precision) will be logged.
